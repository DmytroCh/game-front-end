# Description
This is a custom implementation of German board game "[Mensch Ã¤rgere Dich nicht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch_%C3%A4rgere_Dich_nicht)" (front-end part). When it will be done, users can play together (up to 4 players) and/or play with a bots. 

# Goal
The main goal of this project is to create Smart TV multiplayer game, that's why there is as much as possible logic placed in the backend side (e.g. user don't throw the dice as navigation is not comfortable n TVs), but server does automatically.
